<h1>Louis Armstrong</h1>
<p>Louis Daniel Armstrong was born in New Orleans and sepent most of his youth singing on the street for spare change. Starting at the age of 11 he started to receive formal musical training in prison. This was due to the fact that on New Years Eve Armstrong celebrated by firing a pistol. He was sentenced to 18 months in the Colored Waif's Home for Boys where he learned to play the bugle and cornet from the the Waifs home music teacher, Peter Davis becoming a star performer in its brass band.  </p>
