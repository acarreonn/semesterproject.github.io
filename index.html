<h1>Louis Armstrong</h1>
    
<p>Louis Daniel Armstrong was born in New Orleans and sepent most of his youth singing on the street for spare change. Starting at the age of 11 he started to receive formal musical training in prison. This was due to the fact that on New Years Eve Armstrong celebrated by firing a pistol. He was sentenced to 18 months in the Colored Waif's Home for Boys where he learned to play the bugle and cornet from the the Waifs home music teacher, Peter Davis becoming a star performer in its brass band.</p>

<p> He was largely content to be a journeyman musician, but his second wife, a pianist named Lil Hardin, believed he was too talented not to have his own band. In 1925, while Armstrong was performing in New York, Hardin went behind his back and inked a deal with Chicago’s Dreamland Café to make him a featured act. She even demanded that he be billed as “The World’s Greatest Trumpet Player.” Due to this, a few days after going back to Chicago “OKeh Records” allowed him to make his first records under his own name.</p>

<p>  He and his backup bands, the Hot Five and Hot Seven, went on to cut several dozen records that introduced the world to his improvisational trumpet solos. He trademark scat singing and in 1938, He and his wife divorced. They believed they were less successful together and this is what brought the divorce. After the group hot five and hot seven he played began playing by himself but still remained doing duets with other singers.</p>
